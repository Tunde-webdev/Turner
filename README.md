## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Although i'm nowhere near perfection with the FlexBox(still learning), i sort of enjoy using it! It is somewhat easier to make layouts with the flexbox than floats or grid.


```css
.contents {
    width: 300px;
    height: 400px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 10px 20px 15px 20px;
    color: lightgray;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 10px;
}

.contents {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to be confortable with the flexbox... in my QRcode challenge, i found it tricky centring my div.
